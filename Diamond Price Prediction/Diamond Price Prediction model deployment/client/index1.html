        <h1>Welcome to Diamond Price Estimation</h1>
        <p>
            Diamonds are one of the most sought-after gemstones, valued for their beauty, rarity, and durability.
            However, their prices vary significantly based on several key characteristics. To accurately estimate a diamond’s
            price, it is essential to understand the factors that influence its value.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most widely used classification system is based on the Four Cs—Carat, Cut, Color, and Clarity—which determine a
            diamond’s appearance and desirability. In addition to these, physical measurements like depth, table percentage,
            length, width, and height also play a crucial role in pricing.

    <h2>Diamond Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Carat:</strong> Represents the weight of the diamond, which is one of the most significant factors influencing its price. One carat is equal to 1/5 g.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut:</strong> Indicates the quality of the diamond’s cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal). The cut affects the diamond's brilliance and is an important qualitative measure.</li>
        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Ranks the diamond's color from D (best, colorless) to J (poorest, faint yellow).</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Describes the diamond's internal and external inclusions, rated from I3 (lowest) to FL (highest, flawless).</li>
        <li><strong>Depth:</strong> Represents the height of the diamond as a percentage of its width.</li>
        <li><strong>Table:</strong> Represents the width of the diamond's top relative to its widest point (percentage).</li>
        <li><strong>Price:</strong> Represents the price of the diamond in US dollars, which serves as the response variable in the analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>x, y, z:</strong> Represents the diamond's length, width, and depth dimensions, respectively, in millimeters.</li>
